# üí∞ Transactions App

A simple Android application designed to display financial transactions, categorized into Pending and Completed states. This project demonstrates modern Android development practices, including a clean UI, **robust state handling**, and **multi-theme support**.

## üñºÔ∏è App Showcase

### **Key Application States and Theme**
The app handles various UI states (Loaded, Empty, Error) and supports both light and dark themes.

| Transaction List (Light Mode) | Transaction List (Dark Mode) | Empty State |

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure and Technology Stack

### **Architecture**
The project is structured following the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern. This separation of concerns ensures the code is **testable**, **scalable**, and **maintainable**.

### **Data Handling (Simulated API)**
Instead of external network calls, transaction data is sourced from a **simulated API (`TransactionsApiImpl`)**. This class is designed to demonstrate realistic data fetching scenarios, including:
* **Simulated network latency** (`delay`).
* **Different transaction payloads** (empty, pending, completed, mixed).
* **Simulated network error** (`IOException` failure).

### **Key Technologies Used**
* **Language:** Kotlin
* **Architecture:** MVVM
* **UI Toolkit:** **Jetpack Compose** (For declarative and modern UI development, including dark mode handling).
* **Dependency Injection:** **Hilt** (For simplified dependency management and scope control).
* **Asynchronous Operations:** **Coroutines / Kotlin Flow** (For concurrent, non-blocking data fetching and UI state updates).
* **Serialization:** Kotlinx Serialization (Implicitly used for parsing the simulated JSON data).
